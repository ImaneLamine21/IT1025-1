## Executive Summary 
In this chapter, we will learn more about File and folder compression And Python OOP, and finally, in the last module, we will learn more about OPP and UML. 
## File Compression
File compression, sometimes referred to as data compression, reduces the overall file size to make large files more manageable. It can make large files easier to share or download and take up less space on your hard drive. Compressed file types are ZIP and RAR most commonly, but can also be ARC, ARJ, or CAB.
### Purpose of File Compression
File compression is a data compression method in which the logical size of a file is reduced to save disk space for easier and faster transmission over a network or the Internet. It enables the creation of a version of one or more files with the same data at a size substantially smaller than the original file.
### Compression and File Size
File compression reduces the file size by 90% without losing any of the primary data. Compressing a file is also known as zipping. Therefore, file compression helps the user save a considerable amount of disk space
## Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and the Shark Class
Object Oriented programming (OOP) is a programming style that relies on the concept of classes and objects. 
used to structure a software program into simple, reusable pieces of code 
blueprints (usually called classes),
used to create individual instances of objects.
### Attributes:
The Shark object sammy is using the two methods swim() and be_awesome().In this case, the attribute is a method and it’s called with parentheses, like how you would also call with a function.Because the keyword self was a parameter of the methods as defined in the Shark class, the sammy object gets passed to the methods. The self parameter ensures that the methods have a way of referring to object attributes.
### Methods:
We have created a second Shark object called stevie and passed the name "Stevie" to it. In this example, we used the be_awesome() method with sammy and the swim() method with stevie.
### Constructor:
The constructor method is used to initialize data. It is run as soon as an object of a class is instantiated. Also known as the __init__ method, it will be the first definition of a class.
### Class vs. Object
A class is a blueprint created by a programmer for an object. This defines a set of attributes that will characterize any object that is instantiated from this class. On the other hand object is an instance of a class. This is the realized version of the class, where the class is manifested in the program.

## Object Oriented Concepts
Object-oriented programming differs from traditional procedural programming by examining the objects that are part of a system. Each object is a computer representation of some actual thing or event. 
### Instantiated Objects
 Is the creation of an object (or an “instance” of a given class) in an object-oriented programming (OOP) language. ... In general terms, to “instantiate” an object just means to create it, again, as an instance of a class.
### Inheritance
Another key concept of object-oriented systems is inheritance. Classes can have children; that is, one class can be created out of another class. In UML, the original—or parent—class is known as a base class. The child class is called a derived class. A derived class can be created in such a way that it will inherit all the attributes and behaviors of the base class. A derived class, however, may have additional attributes and behaviors. For example, there might be a Vehicle class for a car rental company that contains attributes such as size, color, and make.
### Encapsulation and Abstraction
Encapsulation means storing or placing data in a single place to make it easily readable and compact in one place. Whereas data abstraction in python programming means to hide internal functionalities that are performing on the application using codes and to show only essential information (class attributes).
## Unified Modeling Language (UML)
The Unified Modeling Language is a general-purpose, developmental, modeling language in the field of software engineering that is intended to provide a standard way to visualize the design of a system
## Conclusion
In this chapter, we learned more about File and folder compression And Python OOP, and finally, in the last module,I learned more about OPP and UML.
