## Executive Summary 
In this chapter, we will learn more about Database, SQL and in the last module we will lear about zEthical and lega issues.

## Data, Information and Knowledge
Data: “raw bits and pieces of information with no context.” 
Quantitative Data: Numeric. The result of a measurement, count, or calculation.
Qualitative Data: Descriptive. Not the result of a measurement or calculation.
Information: Data with context or given some meaning
Knowledge: Information that is analyzed so it can be used to make decisions.
Wisdom: Combine knowledge and experience to gain a deeper understanding of a topic.
### Compare and contrast data, information and knowledge
Data is fragmented pieces of symbols and characters strung together, information is refined data whereas the knowledge is useful information. ... Data is meaningless without being compiled into a sensible structure, while information improves representation and knowledge amplifies consciousness.
### Relational Data
A relational database is a digital database based on the relational model of data, as proposed by E. F. Codd in 1970. A system used to maintain relational databases is a relational database management system. Many relational database systems have an option of using the SQL for querying and maintaining the database, Most popular in use today.
Organized into one or more tables. 
Tables have a set of fields that define the nature of the data stored in the table.
Record = the set of fields in a table.
Popular examples MS Access, MySQL, and SQLlite.
#### Primary Key:
A primary key is used to ensure data in the specific column is unique, It uniquely identifies a record in the relational database table.
#### Relationship between customers and orders:
When assessing the relationship between two given tables, you need to understand how many possible occurrences in one table could belong to an entity in another, and vice versa. For example, let’s use a users table and an orders table. In this case, you want to know how many orders a given user has placed and how many possible users an order could belong to.
Understanding relationships is vital to maintaining data integrity, as it impacts the accuracy of your calculated columns and dimensions. To learn more, see relationship types and how to evaluate the tables in your Data Warehouse.
#### Foreign key of orders table:
The "PersonID" column in the "Orders" table is a FOREIGN KEY in the "Orders" table. The FOREIGN KEY constraint prevents invalid data from being inserted into the foreign key column, because it has to be one of the values contained in the parent table.
### Field Data Types
Think of a field's data type as a set of qualities that applies to all the values that are contained in the field. For example, values that are stored in a Text field can contain only letters, numbers, and a limited set of punctuation characters, and a Text field can only contain a maximum of 255 characters.
### Big Data
Big data is a field that treats ways to analyze, systematically extract information from, or otherwise deal with data sets that are too large or complex to be dealt with by traditional data-processing application software. ... Big data was originally associated with three key concepts: volume, variety, and velocity.
#### Four "V"s of Big Data
IBM data scientists break big data into four dimensions: volume, variety, velocity and veracity.
#### Technology Driving the need for Big Data
The big data analytics technology is a combination of several techniques and processing methods. What makes them effective is their collective use by enterprises to obtain relevant results for strategic management and implementation.
1)Predictive Analytics. One of the prime tools for businesses to avoid risks in decision making, predictive analytics can help businesses.
2) NoSQL Databases.
3) Knowledge Discovery Tools.
4) Stream Analytics. 
5) In-memory Data Fabric.
6) Distributed Storage. 
7) Data Virtualization. 
8) Data Integration.
## Structured Query Language (SQL) 
SQL is a domain-specific language used in programming and designed for managing data held in a relational database management system, or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system.
### RDBMS and SQL
How do SQL and RDBMS relate to each other? RDBMS is a database management system. And SQL is the language used for communicating with data in an RDBMS. Or in the plain term, RDBMS is a book and SQL is the language being used in the book.
### Relationship, Primary and Foreign Keys
Essentially, primary and foreign keys are used as a way to constrain or link related data in a database. This ensures that data remains consistent and that the database contains no redundant data. For example, if you delete a table (or even a row in a table) that other tables rely on, the redundant data is removed.
## SQL Injections
A code injection technique that might destroy your database.
One of the most common web hacking techniques. 
The placement of malicious code in sql statements, via web page input.
## Ethical and Legal Implications
the unauthorized use of hardware, the theft of software, disputed rights to products, the use of computers to commit fraud, the phenomenon of hacking and data theft, sabotage in the form of viruses, responsibility for the reliability of output, making false claims for computers, and the degradation of work.”These problems engender a whole new set of ethical questions, including:
"is copying software really a form of stealing” 
"are so-called ‘victimless' crimes… more acceptable than crimes with human victims” 
"does information on individuals stored in a computer constitute an intolerable invasion of privacy?”
Fourth Amendment
Protects unreasonable government search and seizure
Search warrants – based on probably cause
### Code of Ethics
One method for navigating new ethical waters is a code of ethics. A code of ethics is a document that outlines a set of acceptable behaviors for a professional or social group; generally, it is agreed to by all members of the group. The document details different actions that are considered appropriate and inappropriate.
### Intellectual Property
One of the domains that have been deeply impacted by digital technologies is the domain of intellectual property. Digital technologies have driven a rise in new intellectual property claims and made it much more difficult to defend intellectual property.
Intellectual property is defined as “property (as an idea, invention, or process) that derives from the work of the mind or intellect.”[3] This could include creations such as song lyrics, a computer program, a new type of toaster, or even a sculpture.
Practically speaking, it is very difficult to protect an idea. Instead, intellectual property laws are written to protect the tangible results of an idea. In other words, just coming up with a song in your head is not protected, but if you write it down it can be protected.
### Information Collection
COPPA requires operators (online service providers, website operators, etc.) to
● Provide notice to parents
o Wishes to collect personal information from an individual child
o Type of information it wishes to collect
o Purpose of information collection
o Means by which parents can provide and revoke consent
FERPA. Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act – protects the privacy of student education records
Federal Agency with Oversight – U.S. Department of Education
District Oversight / Responsibility:  Everyone with access to education records
A FERPA violation occurs if a student’s education records are released to unauthorized persons, and may result in the
loss of funding from the U.S. D.O.E.
FERPA requires education institutions and agencies to obtain written permission from the parent or eligible student
in order to release any information from a student’s education record. Educational institutions and agencies are also
required to notify parents and students over age 18 of their rights under FERPA on an annual basis, and provide them
adequate time to request that the student’s records not be shared.  It also provides parents or students over the age
of 18 with the following rights
● Inspect or review the student’s education records maintained by the school within 45 days of request
● Seek to amend education records believed to be inaccurate
● Consent to the disclosure of personally identifiable information from education records, except as specified
by law. Consent may be signed electronically, as long as (1) the mechanism by which the electronic signature
is received identifies and authenticates a particular person as the source of the consent; and (2) the record of
the consent indicates the person’s approval of the information in the consent.
The HIPAA Security Rule requires appropriate administrative, physical and technical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and security of electronic PHI. FERPA is in place to protect the privacy of student education records and designates rights for students and their parents.
## Conclusion
In this chapter, we will learned more about Database, SQL and in the last module was very interesting (Ethical and legal issues).
