In this chapter, we will learn more about Lucichart and how to use it. We will be discussing networking and, finally, cyber security and encryption.

## Lucidchart
Lucichart is an exciting website to explore and create the template. I enjoyed creating my chart about the input of the user. And check the information if it is greater than 12 or not.

## Introduction to Networking
Computer networking began in the 1960s with the birth of the Internet. A computer network is a set of computers sharing resources located on or provided by network nodes. The computers use standard communication protocols over digital interconnections to communicate with each other.

### Data Transmission
Data transmission and reception are the transfer and reception of data over a point-to-point or point-to-multipoint communication channel.
#### Packet: 
The fundamental unit of data is transmitted over the Internet. When a host intends to send a message to another host, it beaks the message down into smaller pieces, called packets. Each packet has the sender's address, destination, sequence number, and some overall news.
#### Packet-Switching:
When a message's packets are sent on the Internet, routers find the optimal route for each packet. After packets arrive, they are re-assembled into the original announcement for the recipient.
#### IP Address:
An IP address is a unique address that identifies a device on the Internet or a local network. IP stands for "Internet Protocol," which rules govern data format sent via the Internet or local network.

#### DNS:
DNS network service converts between World Wide Web "name" addresses and numeric Internet addresses in the entire domain name system. The concept of a name server came about due to the first computer networks in the mid-1970s.

#### Protocol:
A protocol is the set of rules that govern how communication works on a network. 
### Networking Hardware
The primary advantage that a switch has over a hub is the way that bandwidth is distributed. A hub that operates at 10/100 megabits per second (Mbps) must distribute the bandwidth evenly, giving 20Mbps to each node. On the other hand, a switch delivers the full 100Mbps to each node connecting to the network.
Hubs and switches allow the connection of multiple components to form a local area network. At the same time, routers are needed for bridging computers and peripherals on a local network to another network or the Internet.

#### Switch vs. Hub
A Hub is a networking device that allows you to connect multiple PCs to a single network, whereas a Switch connects various devices on a single computer network.
#### Router vs. Switch and Hub
Router and Switch are both network connecting devices. The router works at the network layer and is responsible for finding the shortest path for a packet, whereas Switch connects various devices in a network. A router connects devices across multiple networks.
### Network Topologies
Network topology is the arrangement of the elements of a communication network. Network topology can be used to define or describe the performance of various types of telecommunication networks, including command and control radio networks, industrial field busses, and computer networks.
#### Single point of Failure
A SPOF or single point of Failure is any non-redundant part of a system that, if dysfunctional, would cause the entire system to fail. A single point of Failure is antithetical to the goal of high availability in a computing system or network, a software application, a business practice, or any other industrial system.

#### Infrastructure vs. Wireless Mesh
Wireless mesh network provides stability compared to the rest of the network topologies rather than the node addition or deletion. 
In an infrastructure mesh network, the data forwarding and receiving are via the gateway, whereas in the rest of the web, it is through pair of nodes
### Network Design
Network design is the practice of planning and designing a communications network Network design includes network analysis, IP addressing, hardware selection, and implementation planning. In simple networks, like those found in most homes and small offices, network design is a straightforward process.
### NSA/CSS
The National Security Agency is a national-level intelligence agency of the United States Department of Defense, under the authority of the Director of National Intelligence.

## Cybersecurity and Encryption.
Encryption attempts to make the information unreadable by anyone who is not explicitly authorized to view that data. People or devices can access encrypted data in many ways, but this access is typically granted via passwords or decryption keys.
### Information Systems Security
Information systems security, more commonly referred to as INFOSEC, refers to the processes and methodologies involved with keeping information confidential, available, and assuring its integrity.
#### Security Triad
Confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
These three letters stand for confidentiality, integrity, and availability, otherwise known as the CIA triad. Together, these three principles form the cornerstone of any organization's security infrastructure; in fact, they (should) function as goals and objectives for every security program.

#### Authentication
The most common way to identify someone is through their physical appearance, but how do we recognize someone sitting behind a computer screen or at the ATM? Tools for authentication are used to ensure that the person accessing the information is, indeed, who they present themselves to be. 
#### ACL and RBAC
ACL is better suited for implementing security at the individual user level and for low-level data, while RBAC better serves a company-wide security system with an overseeing administrator. An ACL can, for example, grant write access to a specific file, but it cannot determine how a user might change the file.
#### Ciphertext, Public Key and Private Key
A public-key cipher uses a pair of keys for sending messages. The two keys belong to the person receiving the message. The other key is a private key and is kept secret by the owner. A sender encrypts a message using the public key and once encrypted, the user may use only the private key to decrypt it.
#### Public Key Cryptography
 public-key cryptography is a cryptographic system that uses pairs of keys. Each pair consists of a public key and a private key. The generation of such key pairs depends on cryptographic algorithms based on mathematical problems termed one-way functions.
### Cryptography
Cryptography, or cryptology, is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of adversarial behavior.
#### Encryption
An organization often needs to transmit information over the Internet or transfer it on external media such as a flash drive. In these cases, even with proper authentication and access control, an unauthorized person can access the data. Encryption is a process of encoding data upon its transmission or storage so that only authorized individuals can read it. This encoding is accomplished by software that encodes the plain text to be transmitted (encryption). Then the recipient receives the ciphertext and decodes it (decryption). for this to work, the sender and receiver need to agree with the method of encoding so that both parties have the same message
#### Frequency Fingerprint
Radiofrequency fingerprint (RF fingerprint) extraction is a technology that can identify the unique radio transmitter at the physical level. Using only external feature measurements to match the feature library. RF fingerprint technique has been widely applied to enhance the security of radio frequency communication.
#### Polyalphabetic Cipher
A polyalphabetic cipher is any cipher based on substitution, using multiple substitution alphabets. The Vigen√®re cipher is probably the best-known example of a polyalphabetic cipher, though it is a simplified particular case.
#### Brute-Force
In cryptography, a brute-force attack consists of an attacker submitting many passwords or passphrases with the hope of eventually guessing correctly. The attacker systematically checks all possible passwords and passphrases until the correct one is found.
