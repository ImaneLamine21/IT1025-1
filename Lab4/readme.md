## Executive Summary 
In this lab, we will be discussing three-chapter. The first one is about Operating systems. In the second chapter, we will learn more about python IDLE. Finally, we will talk more and learn more about graphics.

## Python IDLE
Python Shell is a command line tool that starts up the python interpreter. We also can try writing simple and short programs. In the other hand, to be able to write a complex python program we definitely need the file editor. Then we have python IDLE that has combined the two which means it consists of python shell, and of course file editor. 


## Code Examples
### Variable:
A variable in python or any other programming language such as C# or C++ is like a memory location to keep or store values. And a variable has a name and a value that we must assign to it otherwise the variable doesnâ€™t exist. And we have four types of variables in python the first and basic one is int which is used when we use integers. x=1; in this example we have a variable in form of an integer and its value is 1. The second type of variable is long we use it for long integers, and it could also be presented in octal and hexadecimal. Then we have float we use it for floating point real values. And finally, we have the complex variable, and we use it for complex numbers. 
### Assignment statement:
We use Python assignment statements to assign objects to names. The target of an assignment statement is written on the left side of the equal sign (=), and the object on the right can be an arbitrary expression that computes an object.
### Function:
Functions are a common feature among all programming languages. They allow developers to write blocks of code that perform specific tasks. A function can be executed as many times as a developer wants throughout their code. 
### Three data types:
Data types are the classification or categorization of data items. It represents the kind of value that tells what operations can be performed on a particular data. Since everything is an object in Python programming, data types are classes and variables are instance (object) of these classes.
## Graphics

### Raster vs. Vector Graphics
Vector graphics are digital art rendered by a computer using a mathematical formula. Raster images are made up of tiny pixels, making them resolution-dependent and best used for creating photos.
### Lossless vs. Lossy Compression
Compression can be lossy or lossless. Lossless compression means that as the file size is compressed, the picture quality remains the same - it does not get worse. Also, the file can be decompressed to its original quality. Lossy compression permanently removes data.

### File Formats
There are several different types of graphics file formats. Each type stores graphics data in a different way. Use JPEG format for all images that contain a natural scene or photograph where variation in color and intensity is smooth. Use PNG format for any image that needs transparency or for images with text & objects with sharp contrast edges like logos. Use GIF format for images that contain animations

### File Properties
When dealing with files, file properties are pieces of information about that file, which can be accessed via a menu item (often called "Properties"). For example, in Microsoft Windows, you can access the properties of a file by right clicking the file name and selecting
## Conclusion
I have learned more about operating systems and python IDLE, graphics, and image file compression in this lab.
