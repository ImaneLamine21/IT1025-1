## Executive Summary 
Information system has 5 component and one of those is hardware. A personal computer is a device that consists of many components, such as the CPU, the motherboard, the hard disk, and the external storage device. There are various configurations of a personal computer, such as the Android smartphone.
## Hardware
We already know that the information system is made of five components and on of that component is Hardware. So, you’ll be probably asking what a hardware is. So a hardware is all the physical part that you can actually touch. Let me give you some examples desktop computers and laptop computers, also mobile phone and tablets computers the e-readers there is also the storage devices such as flash drives. And there are also the input devices such as keyboards mice and scanner and the last one is the output devices, such as printers and speakers. I hope that now you have an idea about what is a hardware.
### Hard Drives and Memory
Hard Disk is the magnetic disk made of aluminium. It is used as main storage device on the computer. It uses metallic disk which is known as platter. Both sides of disk is used for storing data except the upper side of the uppermost disk and lower side of the lowermost disk. Magnetic oxide is used to coat the data storing surface. 
Memories are made up of registers. Memory refers to the location of short-term data. Each register in the memory is one storage location. Storage location is also called as memory location. Memory locations are identified using Address. The total number of bit a memory can store is its capacity. Memory are of three type : Primary Memory, Secondary Memory, Cache Memory. So, what's the diffrence between hard drives and memory? The diffrence is for example memory is an electronic component that is capable of storing data and information however, hard drive is magnetic disk made of aluminium and used as main storage device of computer. Also memory does need continuous power supply to hold the data and hard drive doesn't need power supply to rertain the data. For instance, memory is a temporary data storage but the hard drive is permanent data storage. Another diffrence is that memory stores data at low speed and hard drive at hight speed. 

#### Latency and Transfer Rates
Latency is the delay time it takes for data to be transferred between its original source and its destination, measured in milliseconds and Transfer rate is a standard metric that is used to measure the speed at which data or information travels from one location to another. It is often expressed in bits or bytes per second, with the prefix changing to accommodate the variable size of the data being transferred such as "kilo," "mega" or "giga." Transfer rate often depends on the technology being used for the transfer.
#### Solid State vs. Hard Drives
The SSD performs the same function as a hard disk, namely long-term storage. Instead of spinning disks, the SSD uses flash memory that incorporates EEPROM "Electrically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory" chips, which is much faster.
Hard drive might be cheaper than the solid state but the use of flash memory instead of disks makes them much lighter and faster than hard disks. SSDs are primarily utilized in portable computers, making them lighter, more durable, and more efficient.
#### Random Access Memory
Memory of also called RAM is the principal memory on the computer. It is also known for its speed it is very fast milliseconds fast. 
Random access memory or also called RAM is the main memory of a computer and it is generally installed on it using double data rate (DDR). As we explained earlier Ram can transfer data much faster than hard drives however it can’t transfer any data as long as the power is off ,contrary of the hard drive that can do so. 

### ALU and the Control Unit
The ALU carries out basic arithmetic and logic operations, and the control section determines the sequence of operations, including branch instructions that transfer control from one part of a program to another. So does the ALU work with control unit? the answer is yes!
The control unit tells the ALU what operation to perform on that data and the ALU stores the result in an output register. The control unit moves the data between these registers, the ALU, and memory.
### CPU, Input & Output
Input is any information that you give to the computer, then this information is converted to binary information. The cames the memory that stores that information that is already converted to binary information. After that the CPU or central processing unit calculates this information to give us an output. This output is a form of colors and writing that you see on the screen.
### Logic Gates 
Logic gates are simply an electric circuit with two inputs and an output. It receives two incoming electric currents, compares them, and sends on a new, outgoing electric current depending on what it finds. A logic gate its role is to examinate and acts like building block for degital circuits. There are seven basic logic gates: AND, OR, XOR, NOT, NAND, NOR, and XNOR. The AND gate is so named because, if 0 is called "false" and 1 is called "true," the gate acts in the same way as the logical "and" operator.
### IEEE - Ethically Aligned Design
An industry-specific implementation playbook that encourages technologists in the financial services to prioritize human wellbeing and ethical considerations in the application of data regarding Artificial Intelligence Systems (AIS)
## Data Representation
### Decimal, Binary and Hexadecimal
Binary number systems use a base of two while hexadecimal uses a base of 16. In a hexadecimal system, it is necessary to count to 15. To represent the numbers 10 – 15, the letters A – F are used respectively. To distinguish the different number systems, suffixes or subscripts are often used.And the decimal is Base 10 Represent any number using 10 digits 0-9.
### Hexadecimal Color Representation
Color might be a practical and emotional tool that conveys personality, sets a tone, and attracts attention, and indicates importance and powerfull. However its effects are neither consistent nor predictable across a population. Approximately 0.5% of adult women and 8% of adult men (4.5% of the total population) have some kind of color insensitivity. Color insensitivity can make it difficult to distinguish hues (red/green color blindness is the most common form), and some rare conditions prevent the perception of hue altogether.

## Conclusion
To conclude in this chapter I have learned many things for example how a computer work and its confuguration and parts of the computer such as RAM, CPU, and the diffrence between hard drives and memory. I have also learned about the three bases the decimal that i have already knew and binary and finaly the hexadfecimal and its diffrence and how to convert between those bases.
