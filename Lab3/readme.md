## Executive Summary 
In this unit we will be learning more about software and its types the ERP, and the virtualization and we will be more aware of the problem resolved by the virtualization, we will also learn some basics of python. Finally, we will learn how to navigate in some very usefull websites such as handshake.


## Software
Software is the set of instruction that tell the hardware what to proceed, or do it was created by programmers and without the software, hardware wouldn't be functional. In the other hand software is devided into two main part we have operating systems and application software and that what we will explore more in types of software.
### Types of Software
The first type is operating system, the second part is the application software. First let's see what is an operating system an operating system is a system that manages the hardware and create the interface between the hardware and the user. In other words its main functions are managing the hardware resources of the computer and it provides the user-interface components and finally it provides a platform for software developers to write. In fact all the comuting devices run and operating system for example in PC we have windows, and Apple does have OS and X, Linux. Another example is smartphone let's take a look so for Apple we have iOS, for Google we have Android...ect 
The second major type of sofware is application software which is a software that allows the user to accomplish some goal or purpose, for example if you want to listen to music you can use iTunes. It is also good to know what is a "killer app" so a killer app is an app that happens to become so imporatnt that a large number of people will buy a device just to use that app. Let me give an example here so for PC, the killer app was the "Spreadsheet" when VisiCalc was intoduced in 1997. You probablly heard about "Productivity Software" so along with the spreasheet that became a a killer app back in the 1997, many other software applications have become standard tools for the workplace, so with that they named them productivity software. so those application that have became tools for the work place allows indeed the employees to finish thei daily tasks at work. For example we have word processing that accually I'm using right now which allows the users like me to create and edit documents using this application.Another good exmaple is spreadsheet and the presentation so the spreadsheet provides its user a way to do numeric calculation and anlysis, and of course displaying the results in charts and graphs. Presentation in the other hand allows its users to create slidehow presentations, the slides can be projected printed, or distributed to interested parties.Another imporatnt thing to mention is in appliucation software there is what we call sub-categories of application, in first place we have Utility software that fix or modify the computer for example disk defragmenter, or A/V programs ..ect.  The second type is programming software that actually make more software for example Java, C, VISUAL BASIC, python..ect.
FYI when you purchase software you are not the owner you are just being given the license to use it respecting the terms and conditions and that follows the fact that the right to use is limited. 
### ERP
ERP or entreprise resource planning is a business managment software that allows an organization to use a system of integrated applications to manage the business and automate many back office functions related to technology, services and HR. In order to effectively implement an ERP system in an organization, the organization must be ready to make a full commitment and intergates all facets of the organization into a single database, application and user interface. Product planning, materials purshasing, inventory control distribution, accounting ect. 

## Virtualization 
virtualization or virtualisation is the act of creating a virtual version of something, including virtual computer hardware platforms, storage devices, and computer network resources.We have two types of virtualization data virtualization and desktop virtualization.
### Problems Solved by Virtualization
It saves on money by reducing the number of servers to run, which also mean the total of the energy used to run the servers decrease. It also good for the enviroment because it's a ngreen technology it saves energy and negate the need to build so many power plants. The third problem resolving is it reduces system administration work, and it gets better use from hardware because the vertualization enables higher utilization rates of hardware, also each server supports enough virtual to increase its utilization from the typical 15% to as much as 80%.
### Role of Hypervisor
Hypervisor is a software that creates and runs the VM's (vertual machine). So what it does is that hypervisor seprates the machine's resources from the hardware and provisions them appropriately so they can be used by the virtual machine.
## Python
### Pseudo-Code Nature of Python
In simple terms, the Python pseudocode is a syntax-free representation of code. So, the Python pseudocode does not involve any code in it. The Python pseudocode must be a very close representation of the algorithmic logic. ... Python pseudocode helps to easily translate the actual code to non-technical persons involved.
### Interpreted vs. Compiled Language
A compiled language is a programming language whose implementations are typically compilers and not interpreters. An interpreted language is a programming language whose implementations execute instructions directly and freely, without previously compiling a program into machine-language instructions.

## Career Exploration
### Handshake
Handshake is a very good way to find interships, work easily I have created my acount and I am planning to do an intership in the sumner of 2022.
### Bureau of Labor Statistics
Is a very easy web site to navigate it you enter your information and what's you're looking for and it will show you all the oppurtunities you might be intrested in.
### Certifications
There are many ceretification, and the one I was very intreseted in is the cybersecurity one.
### Co-ops / Internships
Internships are easier to access and provide a brief understanding into a student's chosen field, an apprenticeship is an on-the-job training and employment program that will provide you with real-world exposure to your chosen field. It also allows the student to have a better knowledge about the major chosen, another great benefit is experience many companies require the employee to have some sort of experience and intership are great for that. 
### Industry Associations / Student Organizations
I am not enrolled in any association or organization yet but i will do. 
## Conclusion

I have learned a lot from this unit for example the software and its types and the process of virtualization and I also had myself enrolled in handshake that I will probably use to get me an intership for the summer of 2022. I have also used python that I found very intresting.
